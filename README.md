Please write a program, preferably in python, that does the following:

1. Calls the site http://www.namefake.com  100 times and retrieves random names
2. For each name break it to first and last name
3. Return the top 10 words that appear most frequently, together with the number of times, each word appeared.
4. Try to implement the program efficiently (should take less then 30 seconds)

Please let me know if you have any questions
